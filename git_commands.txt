Git important points :
->three stage architecture - working directory = put project files which need to improve working area.
			     staging directory = put project files which improved by you and want to make them ready for snapshot for saving.(staging files)
			     git directory = all files hidden and according to command it put those files in working directory.(commit means snapshot) 

->git status 
->git init (start tracking)
->git add --a (all files in staging areas) 
	(or) git add .
->git commit -m "message" 
->git log  (show all commits)
->rm -rf .git (delets .git file)
->pwd (present working directory)
->ls (list contents in folder)
->cd (change directory)
//for ignoring files
-> touch error.log (create log file)
->touch .gitignore (create file gitignore)
   = write "error.log" in .gitignore (to ignore the file)
   = if we write "*.log" in .gitignore (then all the files with .log extention will be ignored)
   = we can also ignore the directory just write "dir_name/" or "path/dir/"
   = blank folder is not specified by git that it is untracked
  
->git diff (it compares working directory and staging area)
->git diff --staged (it compares previous commit with current staging area)
->git commit -a -m "Direct commit" (skipping staging area and it directly commit tracked files.
				     we need not to stage the modified files. single command will do this for us)
				 but untracked files can't be commited directly.
